As a software developer, I had the opportunity to work on an innovative project that created a virtual alternative to the physical Fisherman's Friend "Strongmanrun". The goal was to create a virtual obstacle run that would challenge and entertain the participants, while showcasing the brandâ€™s values.
I was responsible for developing the core mechanics behind the event, such as the parkour experience itself and a competitive scoring system. I also collaborated with another developer, responsible for the server setup and registration system, as well as various builders and a designer, to implement branding and deliver a quality product to the client.
The event was featured in the HeroFest 2022 convention in Berne, attracting many participants and generating positive feedback from both the client and the public. The project was also featured in the media outlet "20 Minuten".
