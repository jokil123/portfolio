The GMTK gamejam 2020 was the first gamejam I participated in. After lots of brainstorming and a few hours of sleep, we decided to make a submarine shmup in 3D. The theme was "Out of Control" and we thought that a submarine would be a good fit for that.

You are placed in a small underwater arena, piloting a submarine in first person. The goal is to survive as long as possible against waves of enemies. The chaos ensued as new enemies spawned when you killed the old ones, eventually overwhelming you with their torpedos.

We used Unity to create the game and Cinema 4D for the 3D models. The game was made in a team of 3 people, with me being mostly responsible for the 3D models and the level design. The other two team members were:

- [Cinnazeyy](https://github.com/Cinnazeyy) - Main Programmer
- [R3tuxn](https://github.com/LordTuxn) - Secondary Programmer & Graphics Design

Special thanks to Virber for playtesting our game!

The game was a lot of fun to make and we learned a lot about game development in the process. Our game arguably wasn't the best, but we were proud of what we accomplished in the short time frame of the gamejam. And considering that it was our first gamejam, we were happy with the result.
