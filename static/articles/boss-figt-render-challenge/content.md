Pwnisher summer 2023 render challenge. Theme: Boss Fight

It was the 29th of July when it was announced. The summer 2023 render challenge by the 3D artist pwnisher. It being summer break, and having had failed to participate before I comitted myself to the challenge. This interations topic was "Boss Fight".

After arriving home from my trip to America, at around the middle of august I only had two weeks remaining but I had a clead idea in mind and finally wanted to submit a render after never doing so before due to various reasons.

These two weeks were quite stressful, but I certainly didn't make it any easier for myself by trying out so many new technologies and techniques. I used arnold renderer for my render engine and tried out their toon module. I mixed this with pyro simulations made in embergen which I converted to look more cartoonish.

After lots of blood, sweat & tears I finally finished my render and composited in after effets. While not getting in the top 100, I was still happy of the render, although I could definitely improve lots of things.
