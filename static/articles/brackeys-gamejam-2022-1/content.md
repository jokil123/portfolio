Our thirst for developing a game was at an all time high, so we decided to participate in brackeys jam once more. This time around however it was a much bumpier ride than ever before, but I'll get into that later.

The theme - as already mentioned - is "It is not Real". As usual, we stuck our heads together and managed to come up with a game idea relatively quickly. Maybe this was due to us being more experienced or already a warning sign that things were about to go south. Our intention was to develop a horror game where you had to fetch a list of items from a dark, spooky cellar. All while being chased by creepy red eyes, seemingly cursed household items.

So what went wrong?
Saying that "it went wrong" might be an exaggeration, but the development most definitely wasnt as smooth was other projects. The fist mistake we made, was the bigger team. We were a team of five people, four devs and one composer. The two new faces were two friends of us who wanted to participate in a gamejam, but didn't really know where to start.

Our second problem was our lack of direction in terms of gameplay and looks. It was but a day before the deadline, when we first had a playable build. Therefore the playtesting took too small of a role.

We still learned a lot dispite us not being very happy with the final result. But I personally still had lots of fun creating the assets and developing the graphics.
