Brackeys Gamejam 2021.2 was the third gamejam I participated in. It's theme was "Let there be chaos" which was right down our alley. After what felt like forever we were finally able to decide on what type of game we would create, a pinball clone of all things.

Our pinball clone was no ordinary pinball clone however. Instead of having just 1 (one) pinball we hade multiple - I know very exciting stuff. All jokes aside, we had a system, where exceedingly more balls would spawn as you were loosing them. This would sooner or later result in you getting overwhelmed by the sheer amount - and chaos - of these tiny ball bearings.

As a player you basically had the choice between playing to the best of your ability, making sure no balls went in the gutter. Or alternatively you could let some balls through, leading to more balls, leadign to a higher score.

This game was one simpler ones we had made so far, which is definitely a good thing for a gamejam, even if our time-limit was seven days. Because our core mechanic was so simple we had much more time to focus on looks, game feel, balancing, marketing and general game-feel.

I want to once again thank my teammate [Cinnazeyy](https://github.com/Cinnazeyy) and a special guest [Waggiswagen](https://soundcloud.com/waggiswagen) who was responsible for the amazing music (as you will unfortunately find out he has deleted his music from soundcloud, but trust me).

**If you wanna take this very original pinball clone for a spin, I reccomend you check it out over on [itch.io](https://cinnazeyy.itch.io/pinball-on-ketamine) as usual.**
