Brackes Gamejam 2021.1 was the second gamejam I participated in. Compared to the GMTK gamejam, this one was a lot more relaxed as the time frame was a lot longer (7 days). The theme was "Stronger Together" and after careful consideration, we once again went for an aquatic theme, a little game where two tugboats have to work together to move a large container ship to it's destination.

The player is able to switch between either one of the two tugs and has to coordinate their movements to get the ship to move in the right direction.

Once again we used Unity as our game engine and I made the 3D models in Cinema 4D. This time we only had two people in our team, both of us being responsible for the programming, with me primarily focusing on the look of the game. This time we focussed much more on the visuals and the game turned out to be a lot more polished than our previous game. The game fit the theme well and we even considered further developing it after the gamejam.

Many thanks to my teammate [Cinnazeyy](https://github.com/Cinnazeyy) and to everyone who played our game!
